# List of projects complete for whilst partaking in the Udacity Artificial Inteligence Nanodegree.

[Build a Sudoku Solver](AIND-Sudoku)
In this project I used a technique called constraint propagation together with backtracking search to make an agent that only considers reasonable solution candidates and efficiently solves any Sudoku puzzle. This approach appears in many classical AI problems, and the solution techniques have been extended and applied to diverse problems in bioinformatics, logistics, and operations research.

[Build a pac man search agent](aind_search)
In this Project I implemented various graph search algorithms to all Pacman to find his food.


[Build a Forward Planning Agent](AIND-Planning-master)
In this project I built a system that used symbolic logic to represent general problem domains and used classical search to find optimal plans for achieving my agentâ€™s goals.

[Build an Adversarial Game Playing Agent](AIND-Isolation-master)
 In this project I wrote an agent that made rational choices to achieve super-human performance in games competing against adversarial agents. I had to write various implementations of the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.

 [Build a sign language recogniser](AIND-Recognizer-master)
 In this project I used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to recognise single words signs using times steps of X and Y displacement.
